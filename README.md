### Description

This is a sample About/Credit form with a nice fade effect. You can specify any background image and can set fade accordingly. You can also specify the Start/Mid/End fade color. You can edit the text by replacing the "*.txt" file in the app folder. If you like this please inform me. Kindly give me your Feedbacks/Comments. Good Luck!
